# 2\^n
This is the official repository for my game 2\^n - a 2048-style block merging game.   
The game can be played here (on PC browser only): https://spookyfish.itch.io/2n   

## How to play:  
- Use your **arrow keys** to move the blocks.  
- Blocks with the same number **merge into one** when they touch.  
- The board **gets bigger** when a target block score is achieved.  
- There are **10 targets** in total.  
## Endgame condition:  
- **You win** when the 10th target is achieved.
- **You lose** when the board fills up before achieving a target.
## Good luck!

**P.S:** The 10th target is **2^50**, which is about **1,125,899,906,842,624**. Good luck with that information!
**P.S.S:**  If it takes 1 second to merge any blocks starting with 2, it would only take about **17,838,807.6 years** and a cosmic amount of luck to beat the game. Again, good luck with that information!
